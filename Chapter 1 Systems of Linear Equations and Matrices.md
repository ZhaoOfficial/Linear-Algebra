# Chapter 1 Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices

## 1.1 Introduction to Systems of Linear Equations

##### 线性方程 linear equation

$$
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 +\dots+ a_nx_n = b
$$

where $a_1, a_2,\dots,a_n$ and $b$ are constants, and the $a_i$ are not all zero.

##### 齐次线性方程 homogeneous linear equation

$$
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 +\dots+ a_nx_n = 0
$$

##### 线性方程组 system of linear equations

A finite set of linear equations. $x_i$ are unknowns.

A general linear system of *m* equations in the *n* unknowns can be written as:
$$
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 +\dots+ a_{1n}x_n = b_{1}\\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 +\dots+ a_{2n}x_n = b_{1}\\
\vdots\\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 +\dots+ a_{mn}x_n = b_{m}
$$
**解 solution:**
$$
x_1 = s_1, x_2 = s_2,\dots, x_n = s_n\qquad(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_n)
$$

### Linear Systems in Two and Three Unknowns

For:
$$
a_1x + b_1y = c_1\\a_2x + b_2y = c_2
$$

1. The lines may be *parallel and distinct*, in which case there is no intersection and consequently *no solution*.
2. The lines may intersect at only *one point*, in which case the system has exactly *one solution*.
3. The lines may *coincide*, in which case there are infinitely many points of intersection(the points on the common line) and consequently *infinitely many solutions*.

相容的 consistent: at least one solution.

不相容的 inconsistent: no solution.

> Every system of linear equations has zero, one, or infinitely many solutions. There are no other possibilities.
