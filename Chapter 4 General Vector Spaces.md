## 4.1 实线性空间 Real Vector Spaces

### DEFINITION 1

Let $V$ be an arbitrary nonempty set of objects on *which two* operations are defined: *addition*, and *multiplication* by numbers called scalars. By addition we mean a rule for associating with each pair of objects $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$ in $V$ an object $\mathbf u + \mathbf v$, called the sum of $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$; by scalar multiplication we mean a rule for associating with each scalar $k$ and each object $\mathbf u$ in $V$ an object $k\mathbf u$, called the scalar multiple of $\mathbf u$ by $k$. If the following axioms are satisfied by all objects $\mathbf u$, $\mathbf v$, $\mathbf w$ in $V$ and all scalars $k$ and $m$, then we call $V$ a vector space and we call the objects in $V$ vectors.

1. If $\mathbf u$ and $\mathbf v$ are objects in $V$, then $\mathbf u + \mathbf v$ is in $V$
2. $\mathbf u + \mathbf v = \mathbf v + \mathbf u$
3. $\mathbf u + (\mathbf v + \mathbf w) = (\mathbf u + \mathbf v) + \mathbf w$
4. There is an object $\mathbf 0$ in $V$, called a zero vector for $V$, such that $\mathbf 0 + \mathbf u = \mathbf u + \mathbf 0 = \mathbf u$ for all u in $V$.
5. For each $\mathbf u$ in $V$, there is an object $−\mathbf u$ in $V$, called a negative of $\mathbf u$, such that $\mathbf u + (−\mathbf u) = (−\mathbf u) + \mathbf u = \mathbf 0$
6. If $k$ is any scalar and $\mathbf u$ is any object in $V$, then $k\mathbf u$ is in $V$
7. $k(\mathbf u + \mathbf v) = k\mathbf u + k\mathbf v$
8. $(k + m)\mathbf u = k\mathbf u + m\mathbf u$
9. $k(m\mathbf u) = (km)(\mathbf u)$
10. $1\mathbf u = \mathbf u$
