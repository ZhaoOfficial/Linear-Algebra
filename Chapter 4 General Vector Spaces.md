## 4.1 实线性空间 Real Vector Spaces

### DEFINITION 1

Let $V$ be an arbitrary nonempty set of objects on *which two* operations are defined: addition, and multiplication by numbers called scalars. By addition we mean a rule for associating with each pair of objects u and v in V an object u + v,
called the sum of u and v; by scalar multiplication we mean a rule for associating with
each scalar k and each object u in V an object ku, called the scalar multiple of u by k.
If the following axioms are satisfied by all objects u, v, w in V and all scalars k and
m, then we call V a vector space and we call the objects in V vectors.

1. If u and v are objects in V, then u + v is in V.
2. u + v = v + u
3. u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w
4. There is an object 0 in V, called a zero vector for V, such that 0 + u = u + 0 = u
for all u in V.
5. For each u in V, there is an object −u in V, called a negative of u, such that
u + (−u) = (−u) + u = 0.
6. If k is any scalar and u is any object in V, then ku is in V.
7. k(u + v) = ku + kv
8. (k + m)u = ku + mu
9. k(mu) = (km)(u)
10. 1u = u
